intro: >
  <p class="lead-paragraph">From coral reefs to misty central mountains, Puerto Rico offers a ripe playground of natural curiosities to explore. </p>

sections:
  - title: Guánica Biosphere Reserve
    class: guanica-biosphere-reserve
    content: >
      <p>Guánica is a rather special slice of nature; now a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, it’s the driest area of Puerto Rico, a phenomenon created by the Central Mountains. It is one of the best examples of a subtropical dry forest anywhere in the world, in stark contrast to the lush El Yunque. What this creates is a compelling place to visit, particularly for bird-watching. Over 50% of the island’s birds can be found here, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican Nightjar. With over 700 types of plant, some near extinction, Guánica is a veritable treasure of rare sights, with unspoilt coastline and hidden mangroves to boot. </p>

  - title: Laguna Grande Bioluminescent Bay
    class: laguna-grande-bioluminescent-bay
    content: >
      <p>This example of just one of Puerto Rico’s bioluminescent bays is a marvel to behold. Large concentrations of dinoflagellates, a type of plankton, congregate here. In the day, it is largely unremarkable, another beautiful part of the island’s shoreline. At night, however, the little critters glow bright in the water, creating an enchanting effect that isn’t easily forgotten. It is forbidden to swim in the bay, so be sure to take a kayak tour to explore the rare pleasure of Puerto Rico’s unique ecology.</p>

  - title: El Yunque
    class: el-yunque
    content: >
      <p>This dense rainforest teems with noisy wildlife and features some breathtaking tropical waterfalls, with natural pools perfect for cooling off after a long trek. Immerse yourself in this tropical gem of the island; with 13 maintained trails of varying difficulty, this is the perfect way to let the rainforest engulf you. Scaling El Yunque is an unforgettable experience ripe for ardent adventurers, and takes you into the heart of the rainforest – a must for any nature lovers.</p>
