intro: >
  <p class="lead-paragraph">Puerto Rico is a culturally charged place, affected by Spanish colonialism, American imperialism and a fierce sense of identity. You can taste it in the incredible food, you can hear it singing from dive bars packed with people dancing, and you can see it all around in the architecture, on the beach, and on the streets. </p>

      <p>Salsa is an endemic Puerto Rican institution, and owes its international popularity to the Puerto Rican immigrant population in Brooklyn. To really experience the island’s cultural mindset, it would be neglectful to not experience live salsa in a San Juan bar – not only for the captivating rhythms, but also for the artful and expert gyrations of the dancers. The perfect introduction, therefore, must be found at the Nuyorican Café, a stalwart music spot renowned for live salsa, live poetry, and an unpretentious, welcoming atmosphere. It is by no means the only place to catch great music, but it certainly is a must-visit to immerse yourself in the frenetic latin beat.</p>

      <p>Explore the charming, narrow cobbled streets and colonial architecture of Old San Juan, and immerse yourself in a boutique shoppers paradise. From luxury fashion brands to local boutiques full of Puerto Rican made goods, ditch the car and put on some comfy shoes to while away the day exploring these charming backstreets. For the souvenir shoppers among you, you’ll find plenty of great gifts – from typical guayaberas (loose fitting shirts worn in the Caribbean)  to vejigante (carnival masks), and renowned rum and coffee (Alto Grande being a must-try). Local artwork and crafts are also in abundance, ensuring Puerto Rican made goods can make it home with you to instill the style of the island into your home.</p>

      <p>Ponce, affectionately dubbed ‘The Pearl of the South’, offers plenty of cultural exploits for any budding intellectuals and history lovers. With a diverse set of museums, even the most voracious history buffs will feel satisfied. For a whirlwind tour of Puerto Rico’s musical heritage, check out the Museo de la Musica Puertorriquena, a beautifully curated selection of instruments and artefacts set in an impressive colonial building. With the sun beating down, walk the grounds of the sympathetically restored Hacienda Buena Vista, a 19th century coffee plantation in remarkable condition. Cool off by discovering the Caribbean’s best art museum, Museo de Arte de Ponce, before heading to Plaza las Delicias to take in the picturesque surroundings and the rather eccentric architectural icon, the Parque de Bombas.</p>
