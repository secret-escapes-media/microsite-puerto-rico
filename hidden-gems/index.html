  <p class="lead-paragraph">If you want to wander off the well-trodden tourist path, check out our selection of hidden gems, perfect for soaking up all Puerto Rico has to offer.</p>

      <p>This remarkably photogenic chapel lies rather unremarkably at the end of a narrow cobbled street in Old San Juan. It’s crumbling facade and modest stature is undeniably charming, and denies any clue to the richness of its interior. Built in 1753, its inception was catalysed by believed divine intervention, wherein a rider and horse (part of a traditional race during San Juan Bautista celebrations) plummeted off the edge of the cliff – all witnessed by the Spanish Secretary of Government, who prayed for the young man’s life. The young man miraculously survived, and built the chapel on the very spot he fell. The altar is silver and gold plated, with oil paintings by famous Puerto Rican artist, Jose Campeche, and has been left completely untouched since 1753. Well, almost; the interior is decorated with tiny silver ornaments of limbs and bodies, each representing an ailment a local wished to have cured. </p>

      <p>Opposite the Nuyorican Café, the most famous salsa bar in Puerto Rico, lies a rather overshadowed night spot called Café Celeste. This closet sized hangout features a jukebox packed with salsa and mambo, otherwise known as a vellonera. Aged and worn, this is a true local’s fave, and is a small part of a whole string of similar bars, each with their own jukeboxes ready to pulsate with the hot frenetic rhythms of salsa and mambo. Spill out onto the streets and mix with the people, as the music plays into the night.</p>

      <p>On the remote island of Culebra, you’ll find stunning Caribbean coastline, with clear waters, golden sands, and... Tanks. During the buildup to World War II, the Americans used this idyllic island as a place to test their munitions, scattering the coast with targets to hit. After years of fed up, petitioning locals, the Navy finally pulled out in the mid-70s – but failed to remove everything from the island. So as you kick-back on gorgeous beaches, you’ll have a selection of tanks for company. Regularly and colourfully painted, the rusting shells make for a rather alternative if not downright bizarre feature that is worth experiencing.</p>
