      <p class="lead-paragraph">Street food is a way of life in Puerto Rico – if you want to really get to grips with the culinary delights this island has to offer, street vendors should be your breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p><p>If you’re near the port, check out Plazoleta del Puerto, where you’ll find a whole square dedicated to serving up delicious cheap eats. Try a Tripleta here, a sandwich stuffed with three meats. On the beachfront of Luquillo, you’ll find over 60 kiosks ready to show you real Puerto Rican cooking. From trad pinchos to alcapurrias, feast yourself silly. </p>
      <p>If that wasn’t enough street food for one day, no journey across the island would be complete without a trip down the Pork Highway – Route 184. Lechoneras line the road serving up lechón asado, roasted pig with rice and peas, a Puerto Rican institution that is a mouthwatering must-try. Once you’re all pigged out, head over to Santurce Mercado in San Juan, where in the day you’ll find a bustling food market packed with street food, and where at night the bars open and the perimeter fills with locals, drinks in hand, dancing in the streets to mambo and salsa.</p>

      <p>Puerto Rico is famous for its coffee, and has been for centuries. Though it now exports far less than it used to, that is slowly changing, and Puerto Rican coffee is once again a thriving industry. Once the choice blend of the Vatican, Puerto Rico’s coffee is characterized by its smooth and sweet qualities. Many of the old Spanish haciendas that served the rich brews centuries ago are being revived, creating an emerging gourmet coffee culture that reveals a taste of old Puerto Rico and its future. A good example of this would be Caficultura, a revival cafe set in a charming colonial building, perfect for sampling a fine local brew.</p>
